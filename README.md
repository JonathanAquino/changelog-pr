# Changelog CI


## What is Changelog CI?

Changelog CI is a GitHub Action that generates changelog,
prepends it to ``CHANGELOG.md`` file and commits it to a release pull request


## How Does It Work:

Changelog CI uses ``python`` and ``GitHub API`` to generate changelog for a repository.
First, it tries to get the ``latest release`` from the repository (If available).
Then, it checks all the pull requests merged after the last release using the GitHub API.
After that it parses the data and generates the ``changelog``. Finally,
It writes the generated changelog at the beginning of the ``CHANGELOG.md`` (or user provided filename) file.
In addition to that, if an user provides a config (json file), Changelog CI parses the user provided config file
and renders the changelog according to users config. Then the changes are committed to the release Pull request.


## Usage:

To use this Action The pull **request title** must start with
``release <space> <version_number><space> <anything else>``
for example: ``Release 0.1.1 releasing a new version``
Changelog CI will see the pull request and only commit the changes to that pull request.

To integrate ``Changelog CI`` with your repositories Actions,
Put this step inside your ``.github/workflows/workflow.yml`` file:

```yaml
- name: Run Changelog CI
    uses: saadmk11/changelog-ci@0.4.0
    with:
      # You can provide any name for your changelog file,
      # defaults to ``CHANGELOG.md`` if not provided.
      changelog_filename: MY_CHANGELOG.md
      # optional, only required when you want to
      # group your changelog by labels and titles
      config_file: changelog-ci-config.json
    env:
      # This will be used to configure git
      # you can use secrets for it as well
      USERNAME:  'test'
      EMAIL:  'test@test.com'
      # optional, only required for ``private`` repositories
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
```


## Example Workflow

```yaml
name: Changelog CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on pull request
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, reopened]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Run Changelog CI
        uses: saadmk11/changelog-ci@master
        with:
          changelog_filename: CHANGELOG.md
          config_file: changelog-ci-config.json
        env:
          USERNAME:  ${{secrets.USERNAME}}
          EMAIL:  ${{secrets.EMAIL}}
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
```


## Group changelog by labels and titles

To group your changelog by labels and titles and have more control
over how your changelog looks you need to use Changelog CI's config file.
Its a ``json`` file you can add it to your workflow by adding this:

```yaml
with:
  config_file: changelog-ci-config.json
```

Example Config File:

```
{
  //  The prefix before the version number. "eg": ``Version: 0.0.2``
  "header_prefix": "Version:",
  "group_config": [
    // You can add any number of sections to group by
    {
      // This will be the title of each section of the changelog
      "title": "Bug Fixes",
      // List of labels from your repository. You can add any number of labels
      // Pull Requests with these labels will be under the title above
      "labels": ["bug", "bugfix"]
    },
    {
      "title": "Code Improvements",
      "labels": ["improvements", "enhancement"]
    },
    {
      "title": "New Features",
      "labels": ["feature"]
    },
    {
      "title": "Documentation Updates",
      "labels": ["docs", "documentation", "doc"]
    }
  ]
}
```

This will look at the pull request ``labels`` and put them under the provided title.
By using the config file the output will be:
