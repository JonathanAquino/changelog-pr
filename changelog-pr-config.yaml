# Config for automated changelog generation using JonathanAquino/changelog-pr.
pr_labels:
  # Use PR labels to add an annotation to the changelog.
  # This list of labels is from https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/#types
  # They are sensible defaults, but you may change them if your repo uses different labels
  # (for example, breaking-changes). The important thing is that they distinguish
  # between breaking changes, features/enhancements, and bug fixes.
  - breaking-changes
  - new-feature
  - enhancement
  - bug
  # Changes to algorithms or methodologies
  - implementation-changes
